I have encapsulated and moved the notifications generated by the system into the NotificationRepository class.

THe main NotificationService class manages the mappings of notificationType to list of notificationsId that were generated. It also has a mapping of notificationStatus to the list of notification id that were generated.
NotificationRepository stores the mapping of all the notifications that were generated. And also exposes funcationalities to add, get or delete notifications.

`notificationIdtoNotificationMap` in the notificationService class can be discarded as it has now moved to notification repository.Apart from that I have tried to add a few comments wherever possible.

PS: I had to reupload the folder as-is again as I did not have git setup on my laptop.
